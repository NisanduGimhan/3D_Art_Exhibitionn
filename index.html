      <h1>About the 3D Art Gallery</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to our virtual 3D Art Gallery. Here, you can navigate through a
        variety of wonderful artworks and learn about their history and
        significance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is brought to you by Emilian Kasemi. We believe in the
        power of art to inspire, provoke thought, and communicate across
        cultures and epochs. Our mission is to make art accessible to everyone,
        regardless of location or background.
      </p>
      <p>
